## Real Solopreneur Wins

### "I Take Real Vacations Now"

## Common Solo Mistakes (Don't Do These)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Perfectionism paralysis">
    **Mistake**: Spending days perfecting agent instructions
    **Fix**: 80% accurate is good enough to start. Improve weekly.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not trusting the agents">
    **Mistake**: Reviewing and editing everything

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Forgetting you're the CEO">
    **Mistake**: Still doing tasks agents could handle
    **Fix**: Weekly audit - "Did I do anything an agent could do?"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Working in isolation">
    **Mistake**: Not connecting with other solopreneurs
    **Fix**: Join our community. Share wins and workflows.
