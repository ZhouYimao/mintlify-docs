Last month, a YC startup used Cagen to handle customer support for 10,000 users with just 2 people. Another raised Series A after showing investors their 5-person team outperforming competitors with 50.

This is your playbook.

## Your Situation

- **Team size**: 1-10 people wearing multiple hats
- **Challenge**: Everything is on fire, all the time
- **Goal**: Achieve product-market fit without burning out
- **Budget**: Every dollar counts

## Week 1: Instant Impact

<Steps>
  <Step title="Day 1: Customer Support Agent">
    **Why this first**: Every minute on support is a minute not building product
    
    1. Use the [Customer Support template](/templates/customer-support)
    2. Feed it your FAQs and product docs
    3. Connect to your support email
    4. Watch it handle 70% of inquiries
    
    **Real result**: "Went from 3 hours/day on support to 30 minutes" - Alex, SaaS founder
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Day 3: Lead Qualification">
    **Why this next**: Bad leads waste precious time
    
    1. Clone your support agent
    2. Teach it your ideal customer profile
    3. Connect to your contact forms
    4. Let it score and route leads
    
    **Real result**: "3x more demos, all qualified" - Sarah, B2B startup
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Day 5: Sales Follow-up">
    **The multiplier**: Never drop a hot lead again
    
    1. Create Sales Assistant agent
    2. Set follow-up sequences
    3. Connect to CRM (or spreadsheet)
    4. Automated but personalized outreach
    
    **Real result**: "25% higher close rate" - Mike, marketplace founder
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Week 2-4: Build Your AI Co-founder

### The Power Combo: Support + Sales + Analytics

## Common Founder Mistakes (Avoid These)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Trying to automate everything at once">
    **Problem**: Spending weeks building the perfect system
    **Solution**: One agent, one problem, one week. Then expand.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Over-engineering for scale you don't have">
    **Problem**: Building for 1M users when you have 100
    **Solution**: Optimize for next 10x, not 1000x
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Ignoring agent mistakes">
    **Problem**: Customers get wrong info, trust erodes
    **Solution**: Review daily in week 1, weekly after. Fix immediately.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not measuring ROI">
    **Problem**: Can't justify cost or show progress
    **Solution**: Track time saved, revenue impacted from day 1
  </Accordion>
