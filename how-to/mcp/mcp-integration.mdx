<Info>
  MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools provide Agents and Actions with secure access to external systems like GitHub, databases, and APIs through a standardized interface.
</Info>

## What are MCP Tools?

MCP tools are external capabilities that you can bind to your Agents and Actions to extend their functionality. Each MCP tool provides a secure, standardized way to interact with specific external systems:

### Understanding MCP Tool Binding

When you bind MCP tools to Agents or Actions, you're giving them specific capabilities:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent Tool Binding">
    **Agents can use MCP tools for intelligent decision-making:**
    ```yaml
    Example: Customer Support Agent
    Bound MCP Tools:
      - github: Create issues for bug reports
      - database: Look up customer account information
      - slack: Notify team members about escalations
    
    Workflow:
      User: "I found a bug in the login flow"
      Agent: Uses GitHub tool to create detailed issue
      Agent: Uses Slack tool to notify development team
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Action Tool Usage">
    **Actions use MCP tools for specific operations:**
    ```yaml
    Example: Weekly Report Action
    Required MCP Tools:
      - database: Query metrics from last week
      - filesystem: Save report to shared folder
      - slack: Send report to stakeholders
    
    Execution:
      1. Database tool: SELECT metrics FROM analytics WHERE...
      2. Filesystem tool: Write formatted report
      3. Slack tool: Send notification with file link
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Tool Permissions">
    **Fine-grained control over what each tool can do:**
    ```yaml
    Security Model:
      - Tools only access what you explicitly allow
      - Different permissions for different Agents/Actions
      - All tool usage is logged and auditable
      - Rate limiting prevents abuse
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Setting Tool Permissions

When binding tools to Agents or Actions, you control exactly what they can do:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Read-Only Access">
    **Safe for most Agents:**
    ```yaml
    GitHub Tool - Read Only:
      ✓ Read repository contents
      ✓ Search issues and pull requests
      ✓ View commit history
      ✗ Create or modify anything
      
    Database Tool - Query Only:
      ✓ SELECT queries for reports
      ✓ Read customer data for support
      ✗ INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE
      ✗ Schema modifications
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Limited Write Access">
    **For specific Actions:**
    ```yaml
    GitHub Tool - Issue Management:
      ✓ Create issues from bug reports
      ✓ Comment on existing issues
      ✓ Update issue labels
      ✗ Delete issues or repositories
      ✗ Manage repository settings
      
    Database Tool - Safe Updates:
      ✓ INSERT new customer records

    **Failed tool calls are retried automatically**
    - Network timeouts: 3 retries with exponential backoff
    - Rate limiting: Intelligent delay and retry
    - Service unavailable: Circuit breaker with graceful fallback
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Graceful Degradation">
    **When tools are unavailable**
    - Agents explain what they can't do
    - Actions pause and wait for tool recovery
    - Alternative approaches suggested when possible
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Error Reporting">
    **Clear feedback on tool issues**
    - User-friendly error messages
    - Detailed logs for debugging

## Troubleshooting MCP Tools

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tool Not Working">
    **What to check:**
    - Is the tool properly bound to your Agent/Action?
    - Do you have the required permissions for the operation?
    - Is the external service (GitHub, database, etc.) accessible?
    - Have you exceeded any rate limits?
    
    **Quick fixes:**
    - Check the tool binding configuration
    - Review permission settings
    - Test the tool with a simpler operation
    - Wait if rate limited, or increase quotas
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Slow Tool Performance">
    **Common causes:**
    - External service is slow or overloaded
    - Tool is making inefficient operations
    - Network latency to external service
    - Too many concurrent tool calls
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Optimize tool operations (better queries, smaller requests)
    - Implement caching where appropriate
    - Limit concurrent tool usage
    - Contact external service if consistently slow
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Permission Errors">
    **Understanding permissions:**
    - Each tool has specific permissions you grant
    - Agents/Actions can only do what you allow
    - External services may have their own access controls
    - Some operations require elevated permissions
    
    **Resolution steps:**
    - Review tool permissions in Agent/Action settings
    - Check external service permissions (GitHub tokens, database roles)
    - Test with minimal permissions first, then expand
    - Contact admin if you need elevated access
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
