<Info>
  Triggers are the starting point of any automated workflow. This guide covers all trigger types and their configuration options.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

- An existing workflow or Issue to attach triggers to
- Understanding of your automation needs
- Necessary permissions for the resources being monitored

## Trigger Types Overview

Cagen supports three main trigger types:

| Trigger Type | Use Case | Example |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Scheduled** | Time-based automation | Daily reports, weekly summaries |
| **Event** | Respond to changes | New customer signup, file upload |
| **Interaction** | Human-initiated | Chat commands, button clicks |

## Setting Up Scheduled Triggers

### Basic Schedule Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Trigger Settings">
    Go to **Work > Issues** → Select your Issue → Click **Configure Trigger**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select 'Scheduled' Type">
    Choose the scheduled trigger option from the dropdown
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Define Schedule">
    Use either simple or advanced scheduling:
    
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Simple Schedule">
        ```yaml
        schedule:
          frequency: "daily"
          time: "09:00"
          timezone: "America/New_York"
        ```
      </Tab>
      
      <Tab title="Cron Expression">
        ```yaml
        schedule:
          cron: "0 9 * * 1-5"  # 9 AM on weekdays
          timezone: "America/New_York"
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Common Schedule Patterns

```yaml
# Every hour
cron: "0 * * * *"

# Every Monday at 9 AM
cron: "0 9 * * 1"

# First day of month at midnight
cron: "0 0 1 * *"

# Every 15 minutes during business hours
cron: "*/15 9-17 * * 1-5"
```

<Tip>
  Use [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru) to validate your cron expressions
</Tip>

## Setting Up Event Triggers

### Configure Event Monitoring

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Event Source">
    Choose what to monitor:
    
    ```yaml
    event_source:
      type: "webhook"  # webhook, file_change, database, api
      endpoint: "https://api.cagen.ai/webhooks/[your-id]"
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Define Event Conditions">
    Specify which events should trigger the workflow:
    
    ```yaml
    conditions:
      - field: "event_type"
        operator: "equals"
        value: "customer.created"
        
      - field: "data.plan"
        operator: "in"
        value: ["pro", "enterprise"]
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Up Event Handling">
    Configure how to process the event:
    
    ```yaml
    event_handling:
      extract_data:
        customer_id: "$.data.id"
        email: "$.data.email"
        plan: "$.data.subscription.plan"
        
      error_handling:
        retry_count: 3
        retry_delay: "exponential"
        fallback_action: "notify_admin"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### MCP Integration Events

For external service monitoring via MCP:

```yaml
mcp_event:
  connection: "github"
  event_type: "pull_request"
  
  filters:
    - repository: "emagen-ai/cagen"
    - action: ["opened", "synchronize"]
    - base_branch: "main"
    
  data_mapping:
    pr_number: "$.number"
    author: "$.user.login"
    title: "$.title"
```

## Setting Up Interaction Triggers

### Chat-Based Triggers

Configure triggers that respond to messages:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Trigger Phrases">
    ```yaml
    interaction_trigger:
      type: "chat_command"
      
      patterns:
        - exact: "/analyze"
        - regex: "^(analyze|review) .+ (report|data)$"
        - contains: ["help", "assist"]
        
      scope:
        conversations: ["all"]  # or specific conversation IDs
        users: ["all"]  # or specific user IDs
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Extract Parameters">
    ```yaml
    parameter_extraction:
      - name: "target"
        pattern: "analyze (.*) report"
        required: true
        
      - name: "timeframe"
        pattern: "last (\d+) (days|weeks|months)"
        default: "7 days"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Button/UI Triggers

For UI-initiated workflows:

```yaml
ui_trigger:
  type: "button"
  
  placement:
    - location: "issue_detail"
      label: "Run Analysis"
      icon: "chart-line"
      
    - location: "inbox_card"
      label: "Quick Action"
      style: "primary"
      
  confirmation:
    required: true
    message: "This will start the analysis workflow. Continue?"
```

## Advanced Trigger Configuration

### Combining Multiple Triggers

Create workflows that respond to multiple trigger types:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: "scheduled"
    cron: "0 8 * * *"
    name: "morning_run"
    
  - type: "event"
    source: "webhook"
    condition: "data.urgent == true"
    name: "urgent_request"
    
  - type: "interaction"
    command: "/force-run"
    name: "manual_override"
```

### Conditional Trigger Activation

Enable triggers based on conditions:

```yaml
trigger_conditions:
  - name: "business_hours_only"
    active_when:
      time_range: "09:00-18:00"
      days: ["mon", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri"]
      timezone: "America/New_York"
      
  - name: "high_priority_mode"
    active_when:
      system_load: "< 70%"
      queue_size: "< 100"
```

### Rate Limiting and Throttling

Prevent trigger spam:

```yaml
rate_limits:
  per_trigger:
    max_executions: 10
    time_window: "1 hour"
    
  per_user:
    max_executions: 5
    time_window: "15 minutes"
    
  cooldown:
    after_execution: "5 minutes"
    after_error: "15 minutes"
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Enable Trigger Logging

```yaml
logging:
  level: "debug"  # info, debug, trace
  
  capture:
    - trigger_evaluation
    - parameter_extraction
    - execution_start
    - execution_result
    
  retention: "7 days"
```

### Set Up Alerts

```yaml
alerts:
  - condition: "trigger_failed"
    threshold: "3 times in 1 hour"
    notify:
      - email: "ops@company.com"
      - slack: "#alerts"
      
  - condition: "no_trigger_in_expected_window"
    expected: "every 1 hour"
    grace_period: "15 minutes"
    notify:
      - sms: "+1234567890"
```

<Note>
  **Pro tip**: Start with simple triggers and add complexity as needed. It's easier to debug simple triggers than complex ones.
