<Info>
  Cagen's Issue system is inspired by Linear's clean, efficient approach to project management, with AI-enhanced workflows and automatic team coordination.
</Info>

## What are Issues?

Issues in Cagen are structured work items that represent:

- **Features** - New functionality to build
- **Bugs** - Problems to fix
- **Tasks** - Work items to complete
- **Improvements** - Enhancements to existing features
- **Research** - Investigation or discovery work

Each issue automatically creates a related discussion channel, keeping work and communication connected.

### Cost Tracking
```yaml
Per Issue: Track AI usage costs for each issue
Per Agent: Monitor which agents use most resources
Per Team Member: Allocate costs to different users
Per Project: Budget tracking for different initiatives
```

### API Key Priority Order
1. **Project-specific keys** - If issue has dedicated budget
2. **Team shared keys** - Default for team collaboration  
3. **Personal backup keys** - Fallback when team quota exceeded
4. **Organization keys** - Final fallback for enterprise plans

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Channel Not Created">
    **Cause:** Issue creation may have failed partway through
    
    **Solution:** Edit issue and save again to trigger channel creation
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Missing Notifications">
    **Check:** Notification settings and channel membership
    
    **Solution:** Ensure you're added to issue discussion channel
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Agent Not Responding">
    **Check:** API key limits and agent availability
    
    **Solution:** Review billing settings and agent configuration
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Related Features

- [Conversations](/how-to/communication/conversations) - Discussion channels for issues
- [Payment Configuration](/how-to/settings/payment-configuration) - Manage AI costs and API keys
- [Memory Bank](/how-to/memory/manage-memory-bank) - Save decisions and research
- [Agent Management](/how-to/agents/create-custom-agent) - Configure AI agents for issue work

<Note>
  Issues in Cagen bridge the gap between project management and team communication. The automatic channel creation ensures every piece of work has a dedicated space for collaboration, while AI agents can participate as full team members.
