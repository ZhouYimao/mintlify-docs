<Info>
  Inspired by [Linear's](https://linear.app/docs/conceptual-model) best practices for human work management, we've designed an Agent-native approach that lets humans and AI work together seamlessly.
</Info>

## Design Philosophy: Agent-Native Work

Issues in Cagen have three key stages that make human-AI collaboration natural:

### 1. Confirm Stage (Optional)
**What it is**: A quick chat to make sure everyone's on the same page.

```
You: "I need dark mode"
Agent: "Cool! Auto-switching with system preference?"
You: "Yep, and make sure it's accessible"
```

Skip this if you already know exactly what you want.

### 2. Deliverables (Required) 
**What it is**: Who does what - crystal clear.

```yaml
Human does:
  - Pick the colors
  - Decide where the toggle goes
  - Test with real users

Agent does:
  - Write all the code
  - Make it work across browsers
  - Run performance tests
```

### 3. Validation (Optional)
**What it is**: How we know it's done right.

```yaml
Checks:
  - Works in all browsers ✓
  - Loads fast (under 50ms) ✓
  - Users love it ✓

Agent can self-fix:
  - If too slow → optimize automatically
  - If tests fail → fix and retry
  - If accessibility issues → adjust and retest
```

## What are Issues?

Issues in Cagen are structured work items that represent:

- **Features** - New functionality to build
- **Bugs** - Problems to fix
- **Tasks** - Work items to complete
- **Improvements** - Enhancements to existing features
- **Research** - Investigation or discovery work

Each issue automatically creates a related discussion channel, keeping work and communication connected.

## Automatic Channel Creation

When you create an issue, Cagen automatically:

### 1. Creates Discussion Channel
```
Issue: "Add dark mode toggle to settings" (#123)
↓
Channel: "#issue-123-dark-mode-toggle"
```

### 2. Invites Relevant People
- **Assignee** - Person responsible for the work
- **Reporter** - Person who created the issue
- **Stakeholders** - People mentioned in the issue
- **Team Members** - Based on labels and project settings

### 3. Links Issue ↔ Channel
- Issue updates appear in channel
- Channel discussions update issue
- Status changes sync bidirectionally

### 4. Sets Up Integrations
- **Memory Bank** - Save important decisions
- **Agent Access** - AI agents can participate
- **Workflow Triggers** - Automated status updates

## Issue Workflow States

</Steps>

## Working with Issues

### Status Updates

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Quick Status Change" icon="zap">
    **In Issue:** Click status dropdown and select new state
    
    **From Channel:** Type `/status in-progress` or `/status done`
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Bulk Updates" icon="list">
    **Select multiple issues** and change status for all
    
    Useful for sprint planning and releases
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Assignment & Collaboration

```yaml
Human Assignment: 
  @alice → Assigns to team member Alice
  
Agent Assignment:
  @dev-agent → AI agent takes on coding tasks
  @qa-agent → AI agent handles testing
  
Multiple Assignment:
  @alice @dev-agent → Collaborative work
```

### Comments & Updates

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Progress Updates">
    **In Issue Comments:**
    - Share progress and blockers
    - Upload work-in-progress screenshots  
    - Link to related pull requests
    
    **In Discussion Channel:**
    - Real-time collaboration
    - Quick questions and answers
    - Context sharing with team
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Stakeholder Communication">
    **Automatic Notifications:**
    - Status changes notify stakeholders
    - Comments trigger relevant notifications
    - @mentions bring people into discussion
    
    **Weekly Digests:**
    - Summary of issue progress
    - Blockers and risks highlighted
    - Next steps and dependencies
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How It Works in Practice

### Example: "Add search to our app"

**Old way**: Design → Wait → Backend → Wait → Frontend → Wait → Test → Done (2 weeks)

**Agent-native way**:
```
Confirm: "Full-text search, real-time, fast"

Deliverables (everyone works at once):
  You: Design the search box
  Agent: Build everything else

Validation: 
  Slow at first (120ms)
  Agent auto-optimizes → 65ms ✓
  
Done in 2 days!
```

## AI Agent Integration

### Agents as Full Team Members

```yaml
Code Generation:
  @dev-agent implement user authentication
  
Code Review:
  @review-agent analyze pull request #456
  
Testing:
  @qa-agent create test cases for login flow
  
Documentation:
  @docs-agent update API documentation
```

  <Step title="Progress Monitoring">
    Agent tracks progress and identifies potential blockers
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Quality Assurance">
    Agent reviews work and suggests improvements
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Views & Organization

# Filter by assignee  
assignee:alice
assignee:@dev-agent

# Filter by label
label:bug
label:frontend,urgent

# Filter by text
title:"dark mode"
description:"api"

# Combine filters
assignee:alice status:in-progress label:frontend
```

### Custom Views

Create saved views for common scenarios:

```yaml
My Issues: assignee:@me status:todo,in-progress
Team Bugs: label:bug assignee:team-frontend

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## API Key Usage & Billing

When AI agents work on issues, API costs are managed through your [payment settings](/how-to/settings/payment-configuration):

### Cost Tracking
```yaml
Per Issue: Track AI usage costs for each issue
Per Agent: Monitor which agents use most resources
Per Team Member: Allocate costs to different users
Per Project: Budget tracking for different initiatives
```

### API Key Priority Order
1. **Project-specific keys** - If issue has dedicated budget
2. **Team shared keys** - Default for team collaboration  
3. **Personal backup keys** - Fallback when team quota exceeded
4. **Organization keys** - Final fallback for enterprise plans

## Keyboard Shortcuts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Navigation">
    **⌘K** then **"issues"** - Go to issues page
    **I** - Create new issue (from issues page)
    **/** - Focus search filter
