<Info>
  This guide assumes you have already completed the [First Agent tutorial](/tutorials/getting-started/first-agent). If you haven't, we recommend starting there for a gentler introduction.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

- Active Cagen account with available Agent slots
- Clear understanding of the task you want to automate
- Any necessary API keys for integrations

## Steps

### 1. Access the Agent Creation Interface

Navigate to **Team > Agents** in the sidebar, then click **Create Agent** or press `C` ‚Üí `Agent`.

### 2. Choose Your Starting Point

You have three options:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="From Template">
    Select a pre-built template closest to your needs:
    - Modify the template configuration
    - Saves time with proven patterns
    - Best for common use cases
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="From Scratch">
    Start with a blank Agent:
    - Full control over configuration
    - Define custom capabilities
    - Best for unique requirements
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Clone Existing">
    Duplicate an existing Agent:
    - Inherit all settings and workflows
    - Modify for new purpose
    - Best for variations of existing Agents
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 3. Configure Basic Information

```yaml
Agent Configuration:
  name: "Market Research Agent"
  description: "Monitors competitors and industry trends"
  avatar: "üîç"  # Optional emoji or image
  status: "active"
```

<Warning>
  Choose descriptive names that clearly indicate the Agent's purpose. This helps when managing multiple Agents.
</Warning>

### 4. Define Agent Capabilities

Specify what your Agent can do:

```yaml
Capabilities:
  core_functions:
    - Web research
    - Data analysis
    - Report generation
    
  permissions:
    read:
      - Public web content
      - Company knowledge base
      - Previous reports
    
    write:
      - Reports folder
      - Team notifications
      
    execute:
      - Scheduled searches
      - Data processing
      - Alert triggers
```

### 5. Set Up Memory Access

Configure what information the Agent can access:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Define Memory Scope**
    ```yaml
    memory_access:
      team_documents: true
      user_specific: false
      external_sources:
        - industry_reports
        - competitor_websites
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Set Retention Policy**
    ```yaml
    retention:
      conversation_history: 30_days
      generated_content: permanent
      temporary_data: 7_days
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 6. Configure Model and Performance

Choose the AI model and performance settings:

```yaml
Model Configuration:
  model: "gpt-4-turbo"  # or "claude-3-opus", "gemini-pro"
  
  performance:
    response_time: "balanced"  # fast, balanced, or thorough
    creativity: 0.7  # 0.0 to 1.0
    consistency: 0.9  # 0.0 to 1.0
    
  resource_limits:
    max_tokens_per_request: 4000
    max_requests_per_hour: 100
    max_memory_usage: "1GB"
```

### 7. Create Initial Instructions

Provide clear instructions for your Agent:

```markdown
## Core Instructions

You are a Market Research Agent for [Company Name]. Your primary responsibilities:

1. Monitor competitor activities daily
2. Track industry trends and news
3. Generate weekly insight reports
4. Alert team to significant changes

### Guidelines:
- Focus on actionable insights
- Prioritize relevance over volume
- Maintain objectivity in analysis
- Cite all sources

### Output Format:
- Executive summaries for quick scanning
- Detailed analysis with supporting data
- Clear recommendations for action
```

### 8. Test Your Agent

Before deploying, test thoroughly:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Interactive Test">
    1. Click **Test Agent**
    2. Give it a sample task
    3. Review the output
    4. Adjust configuration as needed
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Simulation Mode">
    1. Enable **Simulation Mode**
    2. Run through typical scenarios
    3. Check resource usage
    4. Validate outputs
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 9. Set Up Monitoring

Configure how to track Agent performance:

```yaml
Monitoring:
  metrics:
    - task_completion_rate
    - average_response_time
    - user_satisfaction_score
    - resource_utilization
    
  alerts:
    - type: "performance_degradation"
      threshold: "20% below baseline"
      notify: "admin@company.com"
      
    - type: "error_rate"
      threshold: "> 5%"
      notify: "team_slack_channel"
```

### 10. Deploy and Iterate

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Click **Save and Deploy** to activate your Agent
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    Monitor initial performance closely
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    Gather feedback from users
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    Iterate based on real-world usage
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Simple">
    Begin with core functionality and add features gradually. It's easier to expand than to debug an overly complex Agent.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Clear Boundaries">
    Define exactly what your Agent should and shouldn't do. This prevents scope creep and improves reliability.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Regular Reviews">
    Schedule monthly reviews to:
    - Analyze performance metrics
    - Update instructions based on edge cases
    - Optimize resource usage
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Version Control">
    Keep track of configuration changes:
    - Document why changes were made
    - Test thoroughly before deploying updates
    - Maintain rollback capability
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Over-permissioning**: Only grant necessary access
- **Vague instructions**: Be specific about expected behaviors
- **Ignoring feedback**: User complaints often reveal improvement opportunities
- **Set and forget**: Agents need maintenance and optimization

## Advanced Configurations

### Multi-Model Strategy

For complex Agents, use different models for different tasks:

```yaml
multi_model:
  research_tasks: "gpt-4-turbo"
  summarization: "claude-3-haiku"
  data_analysis: "gemini-pro"
```

### Conditional Behaviors

Create Agents that adapt based on context:

```yaml
conditional_logic:
  - if: "urgent_request"
    then: 
      model: "gpt-4-turbo"
      response_time: "fast"
      
  - if: "detailed_analysis"
    then:
      model: "claude-3-opus"
      response_time: "thorough"
```

<Note>
  Remember: The best Agents are built iteratively. Start with a working version and improve based on actual usage.
