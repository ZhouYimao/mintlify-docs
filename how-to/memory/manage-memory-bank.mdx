## How Memory Bank Works

### Best Practice: Action Resource Management

The most effective use of Memory Bank is to store reference materials that your Actions need to query:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Action Needs">
    When creating an Action, identify what information it needs:
    
    ```
    Example: Customer onboarding Action needs:
    - Company policies document
    - Onboarding checklist template  
    - Contact directory for team assignments
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Store Documents">
    Upload these documents to Memory Bank with clear, descriptive names
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Descriptions">
    Write clear descriptions that explain what each document contains:
    
    ```
    Description: "Company HR policies including vacation time, 
    remote work guidelines, and employee benefits. Updated Q1 2024."
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Link to Actions">
    Connect the Memory Bank documents to your Actions so they can reference this information
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Customer Relationship Management Example

Memory Bank excels at managing customer data and relationships:

## Document Descriptions

The Description is crucial for how Agents understand and use your documents:

### Writing Effective Descriptions

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Good Description" icon="check">
    **Clear and specific**
    
    "Customer support knowledge base covering common technical issues, troubleshooting steps, and escalation procedures. Includes solutions for login problems, billing questions, and feature requests."
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Poor Description" icon="x">
    **Vague and unhelpful**
    
    "Support documentation and various helpful information about customer issues and other related topics."
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Description Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with Purpose">
    Begin with what the document is for:
    ```
    "Employee onboarding checklist for new engineering hires..."
    "API documentation for the customer data integration..."
    "Budget planning template for quarterly expense forecasting..."
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Include Key Contents">
    Mention the main topics or sections:
    ```
    "...covering first-day setup, development environment configuration, 
    team introductions, and 30-60-90 day goals"
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Context">
    Include when it was created or last updated:
    ```
    "...Updated January 2024 to reflect new remote work policies"
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Note Special Information">
    Highlight any unique or critical details:
    ```
    "...Includes emergency contact procedures and after-hours escalation"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connecting Memory Bank to Agents

### Description-Only Mode

When connecting a Memory Bank document to an Agent in description-only mode:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="What the Agent Sees">
    ```
    Memory Bank Document: "Customer_Support_Knowledge_Base.pdf"
    Description: "Comprehensive guide covering common customer issues, 
    troubleshooting steps, and escalation procedures. Includes solutions 
    for technical problems, billing questions, and feature requests. 
    Updated Q3 2024."
    ```
    
    The Agent knows this document exists and what it contains, but doesn't have the full text loaded.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="When to Use">
    **Good for:**
    - Large documents that would consume too much Agent memory
    - Reference materials that are needed occasionally
    - Overview documents where summary is sufficient
    - Documents with sensitive information that shouldn't be fully loaded
    
    **Benefits:**
    - Faster Agent initialization
    - Lower memory usage
    - Agent can still understand what resources are available
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Full Text Mode

When connecting a Memory Bank document in full text mode:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="What the Agent Sees">
    The Agent has complete access to all content in the document and can:
    - Quote directly from the text
    - Reference specific sections or details
    - Use the information to make detailed decisions
    - Cross-reference information across the document
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="When to Use">
    **Good for:**
    - Critical reference documents that Agents need complete access to
    - Smaller documents (under 50 pages)
    - Policy documents that require exact compliance
    - Templates or examples that need to be followed precisely
    
    **Considerations:**
    - Slower Agent initialization for large documents
    - Higher memory usage
    - May need to balance number of full-text documents per Agent
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
