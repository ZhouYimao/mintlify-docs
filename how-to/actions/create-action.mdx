<Info>
  Actions in Cagen are automated operations that connect AI agents to external tools, APIs, and services, enabling them to take real-world actions on your behalf.
</Info>

## What are Actions?

All AI agents in Cagen can perform actions through two mechanisms:

### Action 0: Universal Execution
Every agent has access to **Action 0**—the foundational capability to execute any task using Claude Code as the execution engine. Action 0 provides universal functionality that doesn't require predefined configurations.

### Custom Actions: Specialized Functions
Beyond Action 0, you can create **custom actions**—specialized executable functions that allow AI agents to:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="External Integrations" icon="plug">
    Connect to APIs, databases, and third-party services
    
    **Examples:** Send emails, create GitHub issues, update spreadsheets
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="System Operations" icon="cog">
    Perform system-level tasks and automations
    
    **Examples:** File operations, data processing, workflow triggers
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Data Processing" icon="chart-bar">
    Transform and analyze data from various sources
    
    **Examples:** Generate reports, analyze metrics, process uploads
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Workflow Automation" icon="rocket">
    Chain multiple operations together
    
    **Examples:** Deployment pipelines, notification sequences, backup routines
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Action Design Philosophy: Standardizing Business Operations

<Info>
  **Core Philosophy**: Actions are standardized operating procedures (SOPs) designed to automate fixed, repeatable business processes. They transform manual workflows into measurable, iterative systems that improve over time through metrics and feedback.
</Info>

### The Three Pillars of Action Design

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Fixed SOPs" icon="clipboard-check">
    **Standardize Operations**
    
    Convert manual processes into consistent, repeatable procedures that eliminate variation and human error.
    
    ```yaml
    Example:
      Manual: Different team members handle customer onboarding differently
      Action SOP: Standardized 7-step onboarding process for all customers
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Repeating Workflows" icon="refresh">
    **Automate Repetition**
    
    Target processes that happen regularly and consume significant human resources.
    
    ```yaml
    Example:
      Manual: Weekly report generation takes 4 hours each time
      Action: Automated weekly reports generated in 10 minutes
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Metrics & Iteration" icon="chart-line">
    **Measure & Improve**
    
    Set key performance indicators to track action effectiveness and continuously optimize.
    
    ```yaml
    Example:
      Metrics: Processing time, error rate, customer satisfaction
      Iteration: Optimize based on bottlenecks and feedback
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Creating Custom Actions

There are two main approaches to creating Actions in Cagen:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Natural Language Actions">
    **Describe the workflow in plain language:**
    
    ```
    "When a new customer signs up:
    1. Create a welcome email with their account details
    2. Add them to our CRM system with 'new customer' tag
    3. Schedule a follow-up call for next week
    4. Send notification to the sales team"
    ```
    
    **How it works:**
    - Cagen interprets the natural language description
    - Creates a structured workflow that executes each step
    - Handles conditional logic and error scenarios
    - Provides clear execution logs for each step
    
    **Best for:**
    - Business process automation
    - Multi-step workflows with conditional logic
    - Processes that non-technical users need to understand
    - Workflows that might need frequent adjustments
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Code-Based Actions">
    **Write code that executes directly:**
    
    ```python
    # Python example for data processing Action
    def process_monthly_report(month, year):
        # Connect to data sources
        sales_data = fetch_sales_data(month, year)
        customer_data = fetch_customer_data(month, year)
        
        # Process and analyze
        report = {
            'total_sales': sum(sales_data),
            'new_customers': len(customer_data),
            'avg_order_value': sum(sales_data) / len(sales_data)
        }
        
        # Generate output
        create_report_file(report, f"report_{year}_{month}.pdf")
        send_to_stakeholders(report)
        
        return report
    ```
    
    **Best for:**
    - Complex data processing and analysis
    - High-performance operations
    - Integration with specific APIs or systems
    - Tasks requiring precise control over execution
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Using Actions with Agents

### Agent Action Integration

When you bind Actions to Agents, the Agents can automatically decide when and how to use them:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Bind Actions to Agents">
    Connect specific Actions to Agents based on their responsibilities:
    
    ```
    Customer Support Agent:
    - Bound Actions: "send_follow_up_email", "create_support_ticket", "escalate_issue"
    
    Sales Agent:
    - Bound Actions: "update_crm_record", "schedule_demo", "send_proposal"
    
    Operations Agent:
    - Bound Actions: "generate_report", "update_inventory", "process_order"
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Agents Choose Actions Automatically">
    Agents analyze the situation and select appropriate Actions:
    
    ```
    User: "A customer is having trouble with their order"
    
    Support Agent: "I'll help with that customer issue."
    [Executes: create_support_ticket]
    [Executes: send_follow_up_email] 
    
    Support Agent: "I've created a support ticket and sent a follow-up 
    email to the customer with next steps."
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Actions Execute in Runtime Environment">
    All Actions run securely in isolated containers with proper logging and monitoring
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Action Permissions

Control which Agents can use which Actions based on their roles and responsibilities:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Role-Based Access">
    **Assign Actions based on Agent purpose:**
    
    ```
    Development Agents:
    - Can use: code deployment, testing, repository management Actions
    - Cannot use: customer communication, financial Actions
    
    Customer Service Agents:
    - Can use: ticket creation, email sending, escalation Actions
    - Cannot use: system administration, deployment Actions
    
    Management Agents:
    - Can use: reporting, approval, oversight Actions
    - Cannot use: day-to-day operational Actions
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Approval Requirements">
    **Require human approval for sensitive Actions:**
    
    - Financial transactions above certain thresholds
    - System deployments to production environments
    - Customer data modifications
    - External integrations that modify data
    
    **How it works:**
    Agent requests Action → Human receives approval request → 
    Approve/Deny → Action executes or is blocked
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Rate Limiting">
    **Prevent Action abuse:**
    
    - Email Actions: Limited sends per hour to prevent spam
    - API Actions: Respect external service rate limits
    - Resource-intensive Actions: Queue to prevent system overload
    - Cost-sensitive Actions: Budget controls and alerts
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Action Management

### Organizing Your Actions

As you create more Actions, organization becomes important:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use Clear Naming">
    Name Actions based on what they do, not how they work:
    
    ```
    Good names:
    - "send_customer_welcome_email"
    - "process_monthly_sales_report"
    - "escalate_critical_support_ticket"
    
    Poor names:
    - "action_1"
    - "email_thing"
    - "monthly_task"
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Group by Function">
    Organize Actions into logical categories:
    
    ```
    Customer Operations:
    - send_welcome_email, process_refund, escalate_support_ticket
    
    Sales Process:
    - qualify_lead, schedule_demo, send_proposal, update_crm
    
    Internal Operations:
    - generate_weekly_report, backup_data, sync_systems
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Document Dependencies">
    Keep track of what each Action needs:
    
    - External APIs or services
    - Required credentials or permissions
    - Memory Bank documents for reference
    - Other Actions that might be called
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Performance">
    Track how your Actions are performing:
    
    - Execution success rate
    - Average completion time
    - Error patterns and causes
    - Usage frequency by different Agents
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Action Development Best Practices

### SOP Design Principles

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Simple, Iterate Quickly">
    **Phase 1: Minimum Viable Action**
    ```yaml
    Initial Version:
      - Cover 80% of common cases
      - Handle happy path scenarios
      - Set up basic metrics tracking
      - Get user feedback quickly
    
    Example - Customer Support Action:
      V1: Auto-categorize tickets and route to teams
      V2: Add auto-responses for common questions
      V3: Include sentiment analysis and priority scoring
      V4: Integrate with knowledge base for suggestions
    ```
    
    **Why This Works:**
    - Faster time to value
    - Lower development risk
    - Real user feedback guides improvements
    - Builds team confidence in automation
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Design for Measurability">
    **Build Metrics Into Every Step**
    ```yaml
    Action Design Checklist:
      ✓ Each step has success/failure logging
      ✓ Time stamps for performance tracking
      ✓ User satisfaction feedback collection
      ✓ Error categorization and root cause capture
    
    Example - Invoice Processing:
      Step 1: PDF parsing (success rate, parsing time)
      Step 2: Data validation (error types, correction rate)
      Step 3: Approval routing (response time, approval rate)
      Step 4: System integration (sync success, retry count)
    ```
    
    **Benefits:**
    - Identify bottlenecks quickly
    - Prove ROI with concrete data
    - Guide optimization priorities
    - Demonstrate value to stakeholders
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Handle Edge Cases Gracefully">
    **Plan for the Unexpected**
    ```yaml
    Edge Case Strategy:
      1. Identify common failure modes
      2. Build graceful degradation paths
      3. Create human escalation triggers
      4. Log everything for analysis
    
    Example - Order Processing Action:
      Edge Case: Payment fails after inventory is reserved
      
      Graceful Handling:
        - Auto-release inventory hold
        - Send customer notification with payment options
        - Create follow-up task for sales team
        - Log for payment failure analysis
      
      Not Graceful:
        - Action crashes and requires manual cleanup
        - Customer gets no notification
        - Inventory remains incorrectly reserved
    ```
    
    **Implementation Tips:**
    - Use try-catch blocks with specific error handling
    - Set reasonable timeouts for external API calls
    - Provide clear error messages for users
    - Always have a "human review" escape hatch
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Common Action Patterns

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Approval Workflows">
    **Standard Pattern:**
    ```yaml
    Approval Flow Structure:
      1. Request Submission
         - Validate required fields
         - Check user permissions
         - Generate unique request ID
      
      2. Auto-Approval Check
         - Apply business rules (amount, type, user level)
         - If under threshold: auto-approve and notify
         - If over threshold: route to appropriate approver
      
      3. Human Approval Process
         - Send notification to approver
         - Provide approval interface with context
         - Set escalation timer (e.g., 48 hours)
      
      4. Post-Approval Actions
         - Execute approved action
         - Notify requestor and stakeholders
