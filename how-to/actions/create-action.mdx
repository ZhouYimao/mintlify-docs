<Info>
  Actions in Cagen are automated operations that connect AI agents to external tools, APIs, and services, enabling them to take real-world actions on your behalf.
</Info>

## What are Actions?

All AI agents in Cagen can perform actions through two mechanisms:

### Action 0: Universal Execution
Every agent has access to **Action 0**—the foundational capability to execute any task using Claude Code as the execution engine. Action 0 provides universal functionality that doesn't require predefined configurations.

### Custom Actions: Specialized Functions
Beyond Action 0, you can create **custom actions**—specialized executable functions that allow AI agents to:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="External Integrations" icon="plug">
    Connect to APIs, databases, and third-party services
    
    **Examples:** Send emails, create GitHub issues, update spreadsheets
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="System Operations" icon="cog">
    Perform system-level tasks and automations
    
    **Examples:** File operations, data processing, workflow triggers
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Data Processing" icon="chart-bar">
    Transform and analyze data from various sources
    
    **Examples:** Generate reports, analyze metrics, process uploads
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Workflow Automation" icon="rocket">
    Chain multiple operations together
    
    **Examples:** Deployment pipelines, notification sequences, backup routines
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Action Design Philosophy: Standardizing Business Operations

<Info>
  **Core Philosophy**: Actions are standardized operating procedures (SOPs) designed to automate fixed, repeatable business processes. They transform manual workflows into measurable, iterative systems that improve over time through metrics and feedback.
</Info>

### The Three Pillars of Action Design

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Fixed SOPs" icon="clipboard-check">
    **Standardize Operations**
    
    Convert manual processes into consistent, repeatable procedures that eliminate variation and human error.
    
    ```yaml
    Example:
      Manual: Different team members handle customer onboarding differently
      Action SOP: Standardized 7-step onboarding process for all customers
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Repeating Workflows" icon="refresh">
    **Automate Repetition**
    
    Target processes that happen regularly and consume significant human resources.
    
    ```yaml
    Example:
      Manual: Weekly report generation takes 4 hours each time
      Action: Automated weekly reports generated in 10 minutes
    ```
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Metrics & Iteration" icon="chart-line">
    **Measure & Improve**
    
    Set key performance indicators to track action effectiveness and continuously optimize.
    
    ```yaml
    Example:
      Metrics: Processing time, error rate, customer satisfaction
      Iteration: Optimize based on bottlenecks and feedback
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Using Actions with Agents

### Agent Action Integration

Actions become available to AI agents once configured:

```yaml
# Agent can now use actions in conversations
User: "Create an invoice for client ABC for $2,500"

Agent: "I'll create that invoice for you."
[Action: create_invoice]
Parameters: {
  "client_id": "ABC",
  "amount": 2500.00,
  "due_date": "2024-02-20"  
}
Result: {
  "invoice_id": "INV-001",
  "invoice_url": "https://accounting.com/invoice/INV-001"
}

Agent: "Invoice INV-001 created successfully! View it here: [Invoice Link]"
```

## Action Development Best Practices

### SOP Design Principles

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Simple, Iterate Quickly">
    **Phase 1: Minimum Viable Action**
    ```yaml
    Initial Version:
      - Cover 80% of common cases
      - Handle happy path scenarios
      - Set up basic metrics tracking
      - Get user feedback quickly
    
    Example - Customer Support Action:
      V1: Auto-categorize tickets and route to teams
      V2: Add auto-responses for common questions
      V3: Include sentiment analysis and priority scoring
      V4: Integrate with knowledge base for suggestions
    ```
    
    **Why This Works:**
    - Faster time to value
    - Lower development risk
    - Real user feedback guides improvements
    - Builds team confidence in automation
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Design for Measurability">
    **Build Metrics Into Every Step**
    ```yaml
    Action Design Checklist:
      ✓ Each step has success/failure logging
      ✓ Time stamps for performance tracking
      ✓ User satisfaction feedback collection
      ✓ Error categorization and root cause capture
    
    Example - Invoice Processing:
      Step 1: PDF parsing (success rate, parsing time)
      Step 2: Data validation (error types, correction rate)
      Step 3: Approval routing (response time, approval rate)
      Step 4: System integration (sync success, retry count)
    ```
    
    **Benefits:**
    - Identify bottlenecks quickly
    - Prove ROI with concrete data
    - Guide optimization priorities
    - Demonstrate value to stakeholders
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Handle Edge Cases Gracefully">
    **Plan for the Unexpected**
    ```yaml
    Edge Case Strategy:
      1. Identify common failure modes
      2. Build graceful degradation paths
      3. Create human escalation triggers
      4. Log everything for analysis
    
    Example - Order Processing Action:
      Edge Case: Payment fails after inventory is reserved
      
      Graceful Handling:
        - Auto-release inventory hold
        - Send customer notification with payment options
        - Create follow-up task for sales team
        - Log for payment failure analysis
      
      Not Graceful:
        - Action crashes and requires manual cleanup
        - Customer gets no notification
        - Inventory remains incorrectly reserved
    ```
    
    **Implementation Tips:**
    - Use try-catch blocks with specific error handling
    - Set reasonable timeouts for external API calls
    - Provide clear error messages for users
    - Always have a "human review" escape hatch
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Common Action Patterns

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Approval Workflows">
    **Standard Pattern:**
    ```yaml
    Approval Flow Structure:
      1. Request Submission
         - Validate required fields
         - Check user permissions
         - Generate unique request ID
      
      2. Auto-Approval Check
         - Apply business rules (amount, type, user level)
         - If under threshold: auto-approve and notify
         - If over threshold: route to appropriate approver
      
      3. Human Approval Process
         - Send notification to approver
         - Provide approval interface with context
         - Set escalation timer (e.g., 48 hours)
      
      4. Post-Approval Actions
         - Execute approved action
         - Notify requestor and stakeholders
         - Update audit trail
         - Archive request
    
    Common Applications:
      - Expense reports
