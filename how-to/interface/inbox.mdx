## What is Inbox?

Inbox is your unified notification center that aggregates:

- **Direct Messages** - Private conversations with team members
- **Group Chat Messages** - Messages from group conversations
- **Mentions** - When you're @mentioned in topics or channels
- **Issue Updates** - Notifications from work issues you're involved in
- **Agent Responses** - Replies from AI agents you've interacted with

Think of it as your communication command center - everything that needs your attention comes here.
