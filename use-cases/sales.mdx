A B2B startup just closed $2M in new revenue with the same 3-person sales team. Their secret? Every lead gets perfect follow-up, every time, within 5 minutes. Even at 3am on Sunday.

Here's how to build a sales machine that never sleeps.

## The Sales Reality You're Living

- **Leads dying**: 78% of buyers go with whoever responds first
- **Follow-up failing**: Average rep forgets after 2 attempts  
- **Data disaster**: CRM is a graveyard of outdated info
- **Forecast fiction**: "It's definitely closing this quarter" (narrator: it didn't)
- **Rep retention**: Your best SDR just quit. Again.

## Day 1: Deploy Your Always-On Sales Team

### The Lead Response Bot That Beats Everyone

<Steps>
  <Step title="The 5-Minute Magic">
    ```yaml
    New Lead Workflow:
      0-60 seconds: Lead captured
      60-120 seconds: AI enrichment
      120-180 seconds: Lead scoring  
      180-240 seconds: Personalized response
      240-300 seconds: Calendar invite sent
      
    Human competitor: Still drinking coffee
    ```
    
    **Real impact**: 391% more meetings booked
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="The Enrichment Engine">
    Lead comes in with just email â†’ AI finds:
    
    - Full name and title
    - Company details and size
    - Recent news/triggers
    - Tech stack
    - Budget indicators
    - Decision maker status
    
    **Your SDR sees**: Complete dossier, not just a form fill
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="The Perfect Pitch">
    AI crafts responses using:
    
    ```python
    Context factors:
      - Industry pain points
      - Company stage/size
      - Competitor weaknesses
      - Trigger events
      - Persona preferences
      
    Output: Personalized 3-paragraph email
    Response rate: 67% (vs 21% generic)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

**By tomorrow morning**: You'll have more qualified meetings than last week
