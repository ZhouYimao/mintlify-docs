A 200-person company just eliminated 80% of their manual processes. Their HR team of 3 now handles what used to require 10. Operations that took days now happen in minutes.

Welcome to the future of running a business.

## The Operations Nightmare You Know

- **Process spaghetti**: Everyone does things differently
- **Data silos**: Information trapped everywhere
- **Manual madness**: Copy-paste is your middle name
- **Scaling chaos**: Growth = exponential complexity
- **HR overwhelm**: Drowning in admin, no time for humans

Time to build systems that run themselves.
