A B2B SaaS PM just shipped 12 major features in 3 months with 99% user adoption. Another reduced feature development time by 60% while increasing customer satisfaction scores by 45%.

They didn't hire more engineers. They got smarter about what to build.

## The PM Struggle Is Universal

- **Feature factory syndrome**: Building everything, impacting nothing
- **Data paralysis**: Drowning in metrics, missing insights
- **Stakeholder chaos**: Everyone wants everything yesterday
- **User disconnect**: Guessing what customers actually need
- **Roadmap fiction**: Plans that change weekly

Let's build products users actually love.
