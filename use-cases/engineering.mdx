A YC startup just shipped their Series A feature set with 3 engineers. Their competitors have 15. The difference? AI agents handling everything except core architecture decisions.

## Your Current Reality

- **Code reviews**: Taking 2-3 days, blocking releases
- **Testing**: Manual, incomplete, afterthought
- **Documentation**: What documentation?
- **Bugs**: Found by customers, not QA
- **DevOps**: One person doing 5 jobs
- **On-call**: Ruining weekends since forever

Let's fix all of this in 30 days.
