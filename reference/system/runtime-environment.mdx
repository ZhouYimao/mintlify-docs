<Info>
  Cagen's Runtime Environment is an independent, secure containerized system where Actions execute safely and reliably, built on Google Cloud infrastructure.
</Info>

## What is Runtime Environment?

The Runtime Environment is Cagen's secure execution layer specifically designed for running Actions. It provides:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Secure Isolation" icon="shield">
    **Independent containerized system**
    
    Each Action runs in its own isolated container with strict security boundaries and no access to other processes
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Google Cloud Foundation" icon="cloud">
    **Enterprise-grade infrastructure**
    
    Built on Google Cloud Platform with enterprise security, reliability, and global availability
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Zero Security Concerns" icon="lock">
    **Built-in safety**
    
    You don't need to worry about security - the system handles isolation, permissions, and safe execution automatically
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Action-Focused" icon="cog">
    **Purpose-built for Actions**
    
    Optimized specifically for running Action code, whether natural language workflows or direct code execution
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How Runtime Environment Works

### Action Execution Flow

When an Action is triggered (either by an Agent or directly by a user), here's what happens:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Action Trigger">
    An Agent decides to execute an Action, or a user manually triggers one
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Container Provisioning">
    Runtime Environment creates a fresh, isolated container for the Action execution
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Secure Execution">
    The Action code runs inside the container with no access to other systems or processes
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Results Return">
    Action completes and returns results to the requesting Agent or user
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Container Cleanup">
    Container is automatically destroyed, ensuring no data persistence or security risks
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Action Types in Runtime

### Natural Language Actions

When you create Actions using natural language descriptions, the Runtime Environment:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Workflow Execution" icon="list">
    **Structured process execution**
    
    - Interprets natural language steps
    - Executes each step in sequence
    - Handles conditional logic and branching
    - Maintains state between steps
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Error Handling" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    **Graceful failure management**
    
    - Captures and reports execution errors
    - Provides clear error messages
    - Attempts automatic retry for transient failures
    - Rolls back partial changes when possible
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Code-Based Actions

For Actions that execute code directly, the Runtime Environment provides:

## Security Features

### Why You Don't Need to Worry

The Runtime Environment handles security automatically:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Complete Isolation">
    **No system access**
    
    Actions cannot access the host system, other containers, or Cagen's internal infrastructure
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Limited Permissions">
    **Minimal privilege principle**
    
    Actions run with only the minimum permissions needed for their specific task
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Network Controls">
    **Restricted communication**
    
    Only approved external services can be accessed, with all traffic monitored and logged
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic Cleanup">
    **No data persistence**
    
    All execution artifacts are automatically destroyed after Action completion
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Google Cloud Security Benefits

Built on Google Cloud Platform, the Runtime Environment inherits:

- **Enterprise-grade infrastructure** with 99.9% uptime SLA
