## Understanding Resource Limits

### Parallel Actions Explained

<Info>
  Parallel Actions determine how many workflows can run simultaneously. Think of it as lanes on a highway—more lanes mean more traffic can flow at once.
</Info>

**Example Scenarios**:
- **Genesis (10)**: Perfect for individual automation needs
- **Evolution (50)**: Handle multiple client projects simultaneously
- **Singularity (200)**: Enterprise-scale operations

### Memory Storage Scaling

| Plan | Memory Bank | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Genesis | 10GB | ~10,000 documents |
| Evolution | 50GB | ~50,000 documents + integrations |
| Singularity | 200GB | Entire organizational knowledge |

### Team Member Allocation

<Warning>
  Team members include both humans AND Agents. Plan your allocation wisely.
</Warning>

**Recommended Ratios**:
- **Genesis**: 5 humans + 45 Agents
- **Evolution**: 20 humans + 180 Agents
- **Singularity**: 100 humans + 900 Agents
