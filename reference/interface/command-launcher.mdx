## What is Command Launcher?

- **Navigation** - Jump to any page, conversation, or issue
- **Actions** - Execute commands without clicking through menus  
- **Search** - Find agents, memories, or conversations quickly
- **Quick Operations** - Create new items or trigger workflows

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Command Launcher Won't Open">
    **Solution:** Check if ⌘K is being intercepted by browser or system shortcuts
    
    **Alternative:** Use the Command button in sidebar or try Ctrl+K
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Commands Not Found">
    **Solution:** Make sure you have proper permissions for the action
    
    **Check:** Some commands require specific roles or paid features
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Search Results Empty">
    **Solution:** Try broader search terms or check if items exist
    
    **Tip:** Use partial matching - "conv" instead of "conversation"
