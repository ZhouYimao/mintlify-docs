## What is the Inbox?

Your Inbox is the central hub for all notifications and messages requiring your attention in Cagen. It aggregates messages from three main sources:

- **Issue-Related Notifications** - When you're mentioned in issue progression or stage items are assigned to you
- **Private Agent Messages** - Direct communications from AI agents, including scheduled tasks and responses
- **Channel Activity** - When you're mentioned or added to group conversations and channels

## Message Sources

### Issue-Related Notifications

When an issue moves from backlog to in-progress status, Cagen automatically creates a dedicated channel containing all relevant people (issue creator, assignees, mentioned users). You'll receive inbox notifications when:
