  <div style={{textAlign: 'center', padding: '20px'}}>
    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[Marketing Agent] -->|Qualified Lead| B[Sales Agent]
        B -->|Closed Deal| C[Onboarding Agent]
        C -->|Active User| D[Support Agent]
        D -->|Feature Request| E[Product Agent]
        E -->|New Feature| F[Marketing Agent]
