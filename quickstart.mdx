Last month, a cross-border e-commerce startup built their customer service system with Cagen. Now 1 person handles what used to require a 5-person team.

Let's see how this works in just 5 minutes.

## What You'll Need

- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- 5 minutes
- That's it. No coding required.

## Your First Agent in Action

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start here">
    Go to [app.cagen.ai](https://app.cagen.ai) and sign up. Takes 30 seconds.
    
    <Tip>
      No credit card needed for the first 14 days. Cancel anytime.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pick a real problem to solve">
    You'll see three starter agents. Pick one based on your actual pain point:
    
    - **Customer Support Agent** - If you're drowning in customer emails
    - **Sales Assistant Agent** - If you're losing track of leads  
    - **Content Creator Agent** - If you need to produce content regularly
    
    For this guide, let's choose Customer Support (most popular choice).
  </Step>

  <Step title="See it work on real data">
    The Customer Support Agent comes pre-trained on common scenarios:
    
    1. Name it something simple like "Support Bot"
    2. Click "Create Agent"
    3. It will ask: "Want me to handle a sample customer complaint?"
    4. Click "Yes" to see it in action
    
    <Info>
      Watch how it drafts a response, checks your knowledge base, and suggests solutions. This is exactly how it'll work with your real customers.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make it yours (optional)">
    Happy with what you see? Feed it your actual data:
    
    - Upload your FAQ document
    - Connect your help desk (if you have one)
    - Set your brand voice (formal, friendly, etc.)
    
    Or skip this for now and come back later.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test with a real scenario">
    Try throwing a curveball at your agent:
    
    ```
    "Customer says product arrived broken, wants refund but lost receipt"
    ```
    
    Watch how it handles edge cases. Most users are surprised by how well it performs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What You Just Built

In 5 minutes, you've set up something that usually takes weeks:

- A support system that never sleeps
- Consistent responses to customer queries  
- Zero training time for new scenarios

One user told us: "I was skeptical, but after a week, my support tickets dropped by 70%."

## Common Next Steps (What Real Users Do)

Based on data from 1,000+ users, here's what works:

## Real Questions from Real Users

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if it makes mistakes?">
    It will, occasionally. That's why every agent action is logged and reversible. Most users report 95%+ accuracy after the first week of training. You can always override or correct any response.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How much does this actually cost?">
    - **Starter** ($39/mo): Perfect for solopreneurs. Includes 5 agents.
    - **Growth** ($149/mo): For small teams. 20 agents + advanced features.
    - **Scale** ($399/mo): For growing companies. 100 agents + priority support.
    
    Average user saves 15-20 hours/week. Do the math on your hourly rate.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I start small and expand later?">
    That's exactly what we recommend. Start with one agent, see the impact, then add more. You can upgrade anytime. Most users add their second agent within a week.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if I need help setting up?">
    Join our weekly office hours (Thursdays 2pm EST). Real humans answer your questions live. Or use the chat bubble - average response time is under 5 minutes during business hours.
