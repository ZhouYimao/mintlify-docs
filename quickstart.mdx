Welcome! This guide will help you experience the power of AI-native organization in just 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Basic understanding of your business goals
- 5 minutes of focused time

## ðŸš€ Create Your First Agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up for Cagen">
    Visit [app.cagen.ai](https://app.cagen.ai) and create your account.
    
    <Tip>
      Use your work email to automatically join your team's workspace if it exists.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose a starting template">
    After signing in, you'll see our Agent Marketplace. For your first Agent, we recommend:
    
    - **Growth Hacker Agent** - If you want to accelerate business growth
    - **Data Intelligence Agent** - If you need to analyze data and get insights  
    - **Personal Productivity Agent** - If you want to optimize your daily work
    
    Click "Use Template" on your chosen Agent.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your Agent">
    Each Agent template comes with smart defaults. For now, just:
    
    1. Give your Agent a name (e.g., "Growth Genius")
    2. Click "Create Agent"
    
    <Info>
      You can customize everything later. Let's see it in action first!
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Watch the magic happen">
    Your Agent will immediately start working. Depending on which template you chose:
    
    - **Growth Hacker**: Analyzes your website and suggests 3 growth opportunities
    - **Data Intelligence**: Processes sample data and generates insights
    - **Productivity**: Optimizes your calendar for the next day
    
    This typically takes 30-60 seconds.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Interact with your Agent">
    Once your Agent completes its initial task, try asking it something:
    
    ```
    "What's the most impactful thing I should focus on today?"
    ```
    
    Your Agent will respond based on its analysis and understanding of your context.
  </Step>
</Steps>
