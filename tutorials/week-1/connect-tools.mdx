description: "Turn your agent from smart to brilliant by connecting real tools"
---

You've got your first agent running. It's handling basic queries. Now let's give it superpowers by connecting it to your actual tools.

## Why This Matters

Without integrations, your agent is like a smart intern with no access to company systems. Connect one tool, and suddenly it can:
- Pull real customer data
- Update your CRM automatically
- Send notifications when things need attention

## Pick Your First Integration

Based on 1,000+ users, here's what works best as integration #1:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Email (Gmail/Outlook)">
    **Best for**: Customer support, sales teams
    **Time to value**: 15 minutes
    **Impact**: Auto-drafts responses, categorizes inquiries
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Slack">
    **Best for**: Team coordination, internal ops
    **Time to value**: 10 minutes
    **Impact**: Agent joins conversations, answers questions 24/7
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="CRM (HubSpot/Salesforce)">
    **Best for**: Sales and success teams
    **Time to value**: 30 minutes
    **Impact**: Auto-logs interactions, updates deal stages
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Real Example: Connecting Gmail

Let's walk through Gmail since 60% of users start here.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    In your Cagen dashboard:
    1. Click your agent's name
    2. Select "Integrations" tab
    3. Find Gmail in the list
    
    <Info>
    If you don't see Gmail, you might be on the Starter plan. Upgrade to Growth for full integrations.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize Access">
    Click "Connect Gmail" and you'll see Google's authorization screen.
    
    What permissions you're granting:
    - Read emails (to understand context)
    - Draft emails (not send - you control that)
    - Apply labels (for organization)
    
    <Warning>
    Cagen NEVER auto-sends emails without your explicit approval. Every draft requires human review.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Smart Filters">
    Now the smart part. Tell your agent what to watch for:
    
    ```
    Handle emails that:
    - Come to support@yourcompany.com
    - Have "urgent" or "help" in subject
    - Are from customers (not internal team)
    ```
    
    Pro tip: Start narrow. You can always expand later.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test with Real Email">
    Send a test email to your support address. Within 30 seconds, you should see:
    
    1. Email appears in agent's queue
    2. Agent drafts response based on your knowledge base
    3. Draft appears in Gmail with [DRAFT] label
    4. You review and send (or edit first)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor and Adjust">
    First 24 hours are crucial. Watch for:
    
    - **Good signs**: Accurate drafts, time saved
    - **Red flags**: Misunderstood context, wrong tone
    
    Adjust filters and training based on what you see.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Success Looks Like

Here's data from a real user (e-commerce store, 500 emails/day):

**Before Cagen**:
- 3 hours daily on email
- 24-hour response time
- Inconsistent answers

**After 1 Week**:
- 45 minutes daily (just reviewing)
- 2-hour response time
- 100% consistent messaging

## Common Gotchas (and Fixes)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent drafts are too formal/robotic">
    **Fix**: Upload 10 of your best past responses. Agent learns your voice instantly.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="It's flagging internal emails">
    **Fix**: Add filter rule: "Exclude emails from @yourcompany.com"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Drafts are too long">
    **Fix**: Add instruction: "Keep responses under 5 sentences unless complex issue"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Missing important context">
    **Fix**: Connect your knowledge base or CRM for full customer history
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Your Next 24 Hours

1. **Let it run**: Don't over-configure on day 1
2. **Review everything**: But don't edit unless necessary
3. **Note patterns**: What types of emails does it handle best?
4. **Share wins**: Tell your team when it nails a response

## Ready for Integration #2?

Once Gmail is humming (usually by day 5), add your second tool. Most users go with:
- Slack (if you chose email first)
- Calendar (for scheduling automation)
- CRM (for full customer context)

<Note>
**Reality check**: Your first integration won't be perfect on day 1. By day 3, it'll save you an hour. By day 7, you'll wonder how you lived without it.
