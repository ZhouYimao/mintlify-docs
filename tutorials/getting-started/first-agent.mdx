</Info>

### Basic Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Name your Agent">
    Give it a memorable name like "Growth Genius" or "Marketing Maven".
    
    <Tip>
      Choose names that reflect the Agent's role in your team. You'll be interacting with it like a colleague!
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set the initial context (optional)">
    Provide basic information about your business:
    ```
    Website: https://mycompany.com
    Industry: SaaS B2B
    Target audience: Startup founders
    Current monthly traffic: 10,000 visits
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select integration (optional)">
    If you have accounts with:
    - Google Analytics
    - Facebook Ads
    - Email marketing tools
    
    You can connect them now or later.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Advanced Options (Can Skip for Now)

<Accordion title="Model Selection">
  Choose which AI model powers your Agent:
  - **GPT-4 Turbo** (default): Best balance of speed and capability
  - **Claude 3 Opus**: Superior for complex reasoning
  - **Gemini Pro**: Fast and cost-effective
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Memory Permissions">
  Control what your Agent can access:
  - **Team documents**: Access shared knowledge base
  - **Previous conversations**: Learn from past interactions
  - **External sources**: Connect to URLs and APIs
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Action Permissions">
  Define what your Agent can do:
  - **Read-only**: Analysis and recommendations only
  - **Propose changes**: Create drafts for approval
  - **Execute actions**: Autonomous operation (requires confirmation for critical actions)
</Accordion>

## Step 4: Launch Your Agent

Click **Create Agent** and watch the magic happen!

### What Happens Next

Your Growth Hacker Agent immediately begins its initial analysis:

```
üîç Analyzing website structure...
üìä Checking current analytics...
üéØ Identifying growth opportunities...
üí° Generating initial recommendations...
```

This typically takes 30-60 seconds.

### First Results

Your Agent will present its initial findings:

```markdown
## Growth Analysis Complete! üéâ

I've identified 3 immediate growth opportunities:

1. **SEO Quick Win**: Your homepage title tag is generic. 
   Updating it could increase organic traffic by 15-20%.
   
2. **Conversion Optimization**: No clear CTA above the fold.
   Adding one could improve conversion by 2-3%.
   
3. **Content Gap**: Competitors rank for 127 keywords you don't.
   I've prepared a content strategy to capture this traffic.

Would you like me to create an A/B test for the CTA, or should we start with the SEO improvements?
```

## Step 5: Interact with Your Agent

Your Agent is now ready for ongoing collaboration. Try these interactions:

### Ask Strategic Questions

```
"What's our biggest growth bottleneck right now?"
```

### Request Specific Actions

```
"Create an A/B test for our homepage headline"
```

### Get Regular Updates

```
"What were this week's growth metrics?"
```

<Note>
  Your Agent learns from every interaction, becoming more effective over time.
</Note>

## Step 6: Set Up Autonomous Actions

Transform your Agent from assistant to autonomous team member:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Issue (Task)">
    Navigate to **Work > Issues** and create a new Issue:
    - Title: "Weekly Growth Report"
    - Assignee: Your Growth Hacker Agent
    - Schedule: Every Monday at 9 AM
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Define the Action">
    In the Issue content, specify:
    ```
    üìä Generate weekly growth report including:
    - Traffic changes vs last week
    - Top performing content
    - Conversion rate trends
    - 3 actionable recommendations
    
    üìß Send report to team Slack channel
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Activate">
    Click **Save and Start**. Your Agent will now produce this report automatically every week.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Makes Agents Different?

Unlike traditional tools, Cagen Agents are:

1. **Autonomous**: They work independently once configured
2. **Contextual**: They understand your business deeply
3. **Collaborative**: They work with you and other Agents
4. **Learning**: They improve through interaction
