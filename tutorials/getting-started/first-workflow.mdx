## Scenario: Content Creation Pipeline

We'll build a workflow that:
1. **Monitors** trending topics in your industry
2. **Generates** relevant content ideas
3. **Creates** draft articles
4. **Optimizes** for SEO
5. **Schedules** publication across channels

## Step 1: Create the Workflow Issue

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Issues">
    Go to **Work > Issues** in the sidebar
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create New Issue">

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure the Issue">
    Fill in:
    ```yaml
    Title: Weekly Content Pipeline
    Project: Marketing
    Assignee: Growth Hacker Agent (or your preferred Agent)
    Due Date: Recurring weekly
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Design Your Workflow

In the Issue content area, we'll define our workflow:

```markdown

```

## Step 3: Add Action Components

Click the **[ÈúÄË¶ÅÁ°ÆËÆ§ÔºöÂ¶Ç‰ΩïÂú®Issue‰∏≠Ê∑ªÂä†ActionÁªÑ‰ª∂Ôºü]** button in the content editor to add specific Actions:

### Action 1: Trend Research

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Configuration">
    ```yaml
    Action: Research Industry Trends
    Agent: Growth Hacker Agent
    Trigger: Every Monday 9 AM
    
    Parameters:
      sources:
        - Google Trends
        - Reddit (r/startup, r/saas)
        - Twitter trending
        - Competitor blogs
      
      output_format: structured_report
      
      analysis_depth: comprehensive
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Expected Output">
    ```markdown

    [...]
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Action 2: Content Ideation

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Configuration">
    ```yaml
    Action: Generate Content Ideas
    Agent: Same as Action 1
    Trigger: On completion of Action 1
    
    Parameters:
      input: ${action1.output.trends}
      
      idea_count: 5
      
      criteria:
        - SEO potential
        - Audience relevance
        - Our expertise
        - Competitive advantage
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Expected Output">
    ```markdown

    [...]
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Set Up Triggers

Cagen supports three trigger types for workflows:

### Scheduled Trigger (for our example)

```yaml
Trigger Type: Scheduled
Schedule: Every Monday at 9:00 AM
Timezone: [ÈúÄË¶ÅÁ°ÆËÆ§ÔºöÂ¶Ç‰ΩïËÆæÁΩÆÊó∂Âå∫Ôºü]
Active: Yes
```

### Event Trigger (alternative)

```yaml
Trigger Type: Event
Event: New competitor publishes article
Source: RSS feed / Web monitoring
Action: Run competitive analysis workflow
```

### Interaction Trigger (on-demand)

```yaml
Trigger Type: Interaction
Command: "Create content about [topic]"
Context: When mentioned in any conversation
Permission: Team members only
```

## Step 5: Add Intelligence Layers

Make your workflow smarter with conditional logic:

```markdown
### Conditional Logic

IF trend_score > 80:
  ‚Üí Generate 3 content pieces
  ‚Üí Fast-track publication
  
ELIF trend_score > 50:
  ‚Üí Generate 1 content piece
  ‚Üí Standard publication
  
ELSE:
  ‚Üí Skip this week
  ‚Üí Monitor for next week
```

## Step 6: Launch and Monitor

<Steps>
  <Step title="Save and Start">
    Click **Save and Start** to activate your workflow
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Progress">
    Watch the Activity feed in your Issue:
    ```
    üîÑ Workflow started
    ‚úÖ Action 1: Trend Research - Complete (2m 15s)
    üèÉ Action 2: Content Ideation - In Progress
    ‚è∏Ô∏è Action 3: Article Creation - Waiting
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Outputs">
    Each Action's output appears in the Issue Activity
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Workflow Features

### Parallel Execution

## Monitoring and Optimization

### Metrics to Track

<Info>
  Your workflow automatically tracks these metrics. View them in the Issue details.
</Info>

- **Execution Time**: How long each Action takes
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful completions
- **Output Quality**: Based on feedback and results
- **Resource Usage**: Action points consumed

### Optimization Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Basic workflow first, add complexity gradually
2. **Monitor Bottlenecks**: Identify slow Actions and optimize
3. **Iterate Based on Results**: Use metrics to guide improvements
4. **Leverage Caching**: Reuse results when possible

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Workflow not starting">
    Check:
    - Trigger configuration is correct
    - Agent has necessary permissions
    - Action points are available
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Actions failing">
    Common causes:
    - Missing integrations (connect required tools)
    - Insufficient context (provide more details)
    - API limits (check third-party services)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Unexpected results">
    Improve by:
    - Adding validation steps
    - Providing examples of desired output
    - Using more specific prompts
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Golden Rule**: Design workflows as you would delegate to a human team member - clear objectives, defined steps, and success criteria.
</Tip>

### Do's
- ‚úÖ Break complex processes into discrete Actions
- ‚úÖ Include validation and error handling
- ‚úÖ Monitor and iterate based on performance
- ‚úÖ Document expected inputs and outputs

### Don'ts
- ‚ùå Create overly complex workflows initially
- ‚ùå Skip testing with sample data
- ‚ùå Ignore Agent feedback and suggestions
- ‚ùå Forget to set resource limits
