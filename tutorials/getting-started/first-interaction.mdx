## The Two Essential Shortcuts

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="⌘K - Start Anything" icon="command">
    Your **intention receiver** - understands and routes what you want to do
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="⌘J - Process Everything" icon="inbox">
    Your **response center** - handles all notifications and replies
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

<Info>
  **Key Insight**: After ⌘K, you don't wait on screen. Go think, work on other things, or grab coffee. When you're needed, you'll get notified and use ⌘J to jump to your Inbox.
</Info>

**The Flow:**
1. **⌘K** → "create marketing plan for Q2"
2. **Continue your day** → Other meetings, tasks, thinking time
3. **Get notified** → When agents need input or have results
4. **⌘J** → Review, provide feedback, approve

## Try It Now

<Steps>
  <Step title="Press ⌘K">
    Type: `hello` or `create agent` or `show me around`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Press ⌘J">
    See your notification center (Pending, In Progress, History)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete Cycle">
    ⌘K → start something → continue other work → get notified → ⌘J → respond
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Pro Tip: Voice Input

For faster input, we recommend using AI speech-to-text tools:
- Press ⌘K or ⌘J with your fingers
- Use your preferred AI speech-to-text tool to dictate
- "Create agent for customer support"  
- "Reply to Alice about the API update"

Add these to your speech-to-text dictionary for better accuracy:
- **Cagen** (the platform name)
- **Common agents**: dev-agent, research-agent, qa-agent
- **Common actions**: create-issue, deploy, analyze, send-notification
- **Colleague names**: Your team members' names
