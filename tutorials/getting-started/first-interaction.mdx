Welcome to Cagen! Everything you need is just two keystrokes away. Think of these as your **intention receiver** (⌘K) and **response processor** (⌘J).

## The Two Essential Shortcuts

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="⌘K - Command Launcher" icon="command">
    **Press ⌘K** to **start** anything
    
    Your gateway to create, search, and initiate actions across Cagen
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="⌘J - Inbox" icon="inbox">
    **Press ⌘J** to **respond** to everything
    
    Your command center for messages, mentions, and notifications that need attention
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## The Perfect Workflow: Initiate → Process

```
⌘K → Start conversations, create work, launch actions
⌘J → Respond to messages, handle notifications, process replies
```

## How the System Works

### ⌘K: Starting Things (Initiate)
The Command Launcher **understands your intent** and **routes it to the right place**:

```
You type: "create a new agent for customer support"
Command understands: User wants to create an agent
Command routes: Opens Agent creation with customer support template
```

### ⌘J: Handling Things (Process)  
The Inbox **organizes everything that needs your attention** into three states:

```
Pending: New messages, mentions, notifications
In Progress: Things you've started but not finished
History: Completed and archived items
```

## What You Can Do

### Start Conversations
```
⌘K → "chat with dev team about the new feature"
⌘K → "ask @research-agent about user feedback"
⌘K → "start discussion about mobile app"
```

### Manage Work
```
⌘K → "create issue for login bug"
⌘K → "show my tasks"
⌘K → "what's blocked this week"
```

### Access Memory
```
⌘K → "find documentation about API rate limits"
⌘K → "search for customer feedback on dark mode"
⌘K → "show me last quarter's decisions"
```

### Quick Actions
```
⌘K → "deploy to staging"
⌘K → "run tests"
⌘K → "send update to stakeholders"
```

### Handle Responses
```
⌘J → See new messages from team
⌘J → Reply to agent suggestions  
⌘J → Process issue assignments
```

## Smart Intent Recognition

Command doesn't just match keywords - it understands what you're trying to accomplish:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Natural Language">
    ```
    "I need to fix the slow loading issue"
    → Creates bug report issue
    → Suggests relevant agents
    → Links to performance docs
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Direct Commands">
    ```
    "new agent"
    → Opens agent creation
    
    "team meeting"  
    → Creates conversation with team
    
    "deploy staging"
    → Runs deployment action
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Context Aware">
    ```
    In a customer support conversation:
    "escalate this" → Creates high-priority issue
    
    In a code review:
    "merge this" → Runs merge workflow
    
    In project planning:
    "add milestone" → Creates project milestone
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Your First Interactions

Let's try both shortcuts:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Try Command Launcher (⌘K)">
    Press **⌘K** and type:
    - `hello` - Get started with conversations
    - `create agent` - See agent creation options
    - `show me around` - Take the guided tour
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Try Inbox (⌘J)">
    Press **⌘J** to see your notification center
    
    Even if empty, you'll see the three states: Pending, In Progress, History
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="The Complete Cycle">
    1. **⌘K** → `start conversation with team`
    2. **⌘J** → See responses when they come in
    3. Reply directly from Inbox or jump to full conversation
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Both Together

### The Daily Flow

**Morning**: Start with ⌘J to see what happened overnight
```
⌘J → Check pending messages
→ Reply to urgent items  
→ Move others to In Progress
```

**Throughout the day**: Use ⌘K to initiate new work
```
⌘K → "create issue for bug fix"
⌘K → "schedule team meeting"  
⌘K → "ask @research-agent about metrics"

# With voice input (after pressing ⌘K):
Speak: "Ask dev agent to review the login code"
Speak: "Create meeting with Alice and Bob about the new feature"
```

**Evening**: Process with ⌘J
```
⌘J → Review In Progress items
→ Complete finished tasks
→ Plan tomorrow's priorities
```

## Command in Different Contexts

### In Conversations
When you're in a conversation, Command becomes conversation-aware:

```
⌘K → "invite alice to this chat"
⌘K → "create issue from this discussion"  
⌘K → "save this decision to memory"
⌘K → "summarize this conversation"
```

### In Work View
When managing work, Command focuses on work-related actions:

```
⌘K → "assign this to @dev-agent"
⌘K → "move to in progress"
⌘K → "create subtask"
⌘K → "notify stakeholders"
```

### In Memory Bank
When browsing memory, Command helps with knowledge management:

```
⌘K → "tag this as important"
⌘K → "link to related document"
⌘K → "share with team"
⌘K → "create template from this"
```

## Tips for Better Commands

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="target">
    Instead of "help"
    Try "help me create a QA agent"
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Use Context" icon="layer-group">
    Command knows where you are
    "Add to this project" works in project view
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Natural Language" icon="comment">
    "I need to track bug reports"
    Works better than just "bugs"
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Agent Names" icon="robot">
    "@dev-agent review this code"
    Directly engages specific agents
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Patterns

### The "I Need To..." Pattern
```
"I need to deploy the latest changes"
"I need to check on the marketing campaign"
"I need to find that API documentation"
```

### The "Show Me..." Pattern  
```
"Show me today's issues"
"Show me team performance"
"Show me last week's decisions"
```

### The "Create..." Pattern
```
"Create meeting notes"
"Create bug report"  
"Create agent for data analysis"
```

## Advanced Command Usage

### Chaining Actions
Command can understand multi-step requests:

```
"Create issue for API bug, assign to dev team, and notify product manager"

Result:
1. Creates issue
2. Assigns to @dev-team  
3. Sends notification to PM
```

### Smart Defaults
Command learns your patterns:

```
First time: "create agent" → Shows all options
After a few uses: "create agent" → Suggests your most-used types
```

### Context Switching
Jump between different areas quickly:

```
"Switch to customer feedback memory"
"Go to this week's sprint"
"Open conversation with design team"
```

## Quick Inbox Actions

### From Any Inbox Item:
- **R** - Quick reply without leaving Inbox
- **C** - Mark as complete (moves to History)
- **A** - Archive without taking action
- **Space** - Move to In Progress
- **Enter** - Open full context

### Batch Operations:
```
⌘J → Select multiple items → A (archive all)
⌘J → Select messages → C (complete all)
⌘J → Filter by type → Process similar items together
```

## Pro Tips

### Use AI Voice Input
For lightning-fast interactions, use **AI voice input** after pressing the shortcuts:

<Card title="Voice Input Setup" icon="microphone">
  **Add to your voice input dictionary:**
  - **Cagen** - The platform name
  - **Colleague names** - Alice, Bob, Sarah, etc.
  - **Common agents** - dev-agent, research-agent, qa-agent
  - **Action names** - deploy, analyze, create-issue, send-notification
  
  **How it works:**
  1. Press ⌘K (fingers)
  2. Speak naturally: "create agent for customer support"
  3. Press ⌘J (fingers) 
  4. Speak naturally: "reply to Alice about the API update"
</Card>

### Smart Filtering in Inbox
Filter your notifications with queries:
```
from:alice          # Messages from Alice
type:mention        # Only @mentions
status:pending      # Unread items
has:attachment      # Items with files
```

### When Command Can't Help
If ⌘K doesn't understand something:
1. **Suggests alternatives** based on what you typed
2. **Shows recent actions** you might want to repeat
3. **Offers to search** across all your content
4. **Connects you with help** documentation

<Tip>
  **Speed up with voice**: Press ⌘K or ⌘J with your fingers, then speak naturally. Add Cagen, colleague names, and agent names to your voice dictionary for better accuracy. The more you use both shortcuts, the smarter they get at understanding your intentions!
</Tip>

## The Complete Picture

**⌘K is for starting** - your intention receiver that understands what you want and routes it to the right place.

**⌘J is for processing** - your response center that organizes everything needing attention into manageable states.

Together, they create a seamless workflow:
```
Initiate (⌘K) → Work happens → Process responses (⌘J) → Repeat
```
