Last year, a 3-person startup used Cagen to handle customer support for 50,000 users. No outsourcing. No 80-hour weeks. Just smart agent design.

Here's how they (and 1,000+ other teams) did it.

## Who Actually Uses Cagen?

Real users, real results:

- **E-commerce Founder** (Singapore): "Handles customer service in 6 languages. Saved $8k/month."
- **SaaS Developer** (Toronto): "My QA agent catches bugs before users do. Ship 3x faster now."
- **Marketing Agency** (Austin): "5 people managing 50 client accounts. Couldn't scale without Cagen."
- **Course Creator** (Remote): "Student support runs itself. I focus on content now."

## The Difference You'll Feel in Week 1

### What you're probably using now:
- ChatGPT for one-off tasks
- Zapier for simple automations  
- Virtual assistants that need constant supervision
- Tools that work in isolation

### What Cagen gives you:
- Agents that remember everything (your customers, your processes, your preferences)
- Agents that talk to each other (Sales → Support → Analytics, automatically)
- Work that happens while you sleep (literally)
- A team that scales without hiring

Whatever it is, you can fix it today. Not next quarter. Today.
