<Info>
  This document explains Cagen's URL architecture decisions and their implications for SEO, analytics, and user experience.
</Info>

## Architecture Decision: Path-Based URLs

Cagen uses a **path-based URL structure** rather than subdomains. This means:

- ✅ `cagen.ai/app/{org}` (chosen approach)
- ❌ `app.cagen.ai/{org}` (alternative considered)

## URL Structure Overview

```
cagen.ai/
├── /                        # Marketing homepage
├── /pricing                 # Pricing information
├── /docs                    # Documentation (you are here)
├── /blog                    # Content marketing
├── /store                   # Public marketplace
│   ├── /store/agents        # Browse public Agents
│   ├── /store/workflows     # Browse public workflows
│   └── /store/templates     # Browse templates
├── /app                     # Application entry
│   ├── /app/auth            # Authentication flows
│   ├── /app/public          # Public app features
│   └── /app/{org}           # Private organization spaces
│       ├── /agents          # Organization's Agents
│       ├── /workflows       # Organization's workflows
│       ├── /memory          # Memory Bank
│       └── /settings        # Organization settings
└── /api                     # API endpoints
```

## Implementation Considerations

### Routing Strategy

```nginx
# Nginx configuration example
location /app {
    proxy_pass http://app-backend;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Original-URI $request_uri;
}

location /store {
    proxy_pass http://store-backend;
    # Public content, aggressive caching
    proxy_cache_valid 200 1h;
}

location /api {
    proxy_pass http://api-backend;
    # API rate limiting per path
    limit_req zone=api_limit burst=100;
}
```

### Security Boundaries

Despite sharing the same domain, we maintain security through:

1. **Path-based permissions**: Different security policies per path
2. **Authentication scoping**: JWT tokens scoped to specific paths
3. **Rate limiting**: Different limits for `/api` vs `/app` vs `/store`
4. **CSP headers**: Content Security Policy varies by path

### Migration Path

For users with existing bookmarks or integrations:

```yaml
redirects:
  - from: "https://app.cagen.ai/*"
    to: "https://cagen.ai/app/*"
    status: 301
    preserve_query: true
    
  - from: "https://docs.cagen.ai/*"
    to: "https://cagen.ai/docs/*"
    status: 301
```

## Store Integration

The public Store benefits significantly from this architecture:

<Info>
  Store content at `cagen.ai/store` inherits domain authority, making community-created Agents and workflows more discoverable through search engines.
</Info>

### Store URL Examples

```
# Public Agent profiles
cagen.ai/store/agents/growth-hacker
cagen.ai/store/agents/customer-success

# Workflow templates
cagen.ai/store/workflows/daily-standup
cagen.ai/store/workflows/content-pipeline

# Creator profiles
cagen.ai/store/creators/acme-corp
cagen.ai/store/creators/john-doe
```

    - Monitor performance per path
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Future Considerations

As Cagen grows, we may introduce:

1. **Regional paths**: `/eu/app/{org}` for data residency
2. **API versioning**: `/api/v2/` for backward compatibility
3. **Feature flags**: Path-based feature rollouts
4. **A/B testing**: Different experiences per path

## Conclusion

The path-based URL architecture provides the optimal balance of:
- **SEO benefits** for discoverability
- **Analytics clarity** for business insights
- **Technical simplicity** for maintenance
- **User experience** for navigation

This architecture decision aligns with Cagen's mission to build an accessible, discoverable platform for AI-Native Organizations.

<Note>
  This architecture decision was made after careful consideration of Cagen's unique requirements: a public Store for discovery, private organization spaces for work, and the need for strong SEO to reach global markets.
